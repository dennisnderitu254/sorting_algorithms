1. First, it checks if the shaker is not NULL. If it is, it returns.
2. It swaps the node pointed by shaker with the node pointed by shaker->next.
3. It checks if the node pointed by shaker is not the tail. If it is, it returns.
4. It checks if the node pointed by shaker->prev is not NULL. If it is, it means that the node pointed by shaker is the head. So, it sets the head to the node pointed by shaker->next.
5. It checks if the node pointed by shaker->next is not NULL. If it is, it means that the node pointed by shaker is the tail. So, it sets the tail to the node pointed by shaker->prev.
6. It sets the next node of the node pointed by shaker to the node pointed by shaker->prev.
7. It sets the previous node of the node pointed by shaker->next to the node pointed by shaker.
8. It sets the previous node of the node pointed by shaker to the node pointed by shaker->next.
9. It sets the next node of the node pointed by shaker to the node pointed by shaker->prev.
10. First, we swap the node behind the shaker with the node in front of the shaker.
11. Then, we swap the node in front of the shaker with the node behind the shaker.
12. Finally, we swap the node behind the shaker with the node in front of the shaker again.
13.It sorts a list using the cocktail sort algorithm.
