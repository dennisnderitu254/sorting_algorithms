1. The function starts by checking if the list is NULL or if it has only one element. If so, it returns.
2. The function then initializes the iterator to the first element of the list.
3. The function then loops through the list, starting with the second element.
4. The function then initializes the insert variable to the previous element of the iterator.
5. The function then loops through the list, starting with the previous element of the iterator.
6. The function then checks if the iterator is greater than the insert variable.
7. If so, the function swaps the nodes and prints the list.
8. The function then sets the insert variable to the previous element of the iterator.
9. The function then loops through the list, starting with the previous element of the iterator.
10. The function then checks if the iterator is greater than the insert variable.
11. If so, the function swaps the nodes and prints the list.
12. The function then sets the iterator to the next element of the list.
13. The function then loops through the list, starting with the second element.
14. The function then returns.
