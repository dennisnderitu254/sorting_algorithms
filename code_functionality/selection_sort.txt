1. The outer loop is responsible for selecting the smallest element in the array
    and swapping it with the element in the first position.

2. The inner loop is responsible for finding the smallest element in the remaining subarray
    and swapping it with the element in the second position.

3. The inner loop continues to find the smallest element in the remaining subarray
    and swapping it with the element in the third position, and so on.

4. The outer loop then repeats the process for the remaining elements in the array.
