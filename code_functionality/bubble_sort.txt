1. The function takes two parameters: an array of integers and the size of the array.
2. The function checks to make sure the array is not NULL and that the size is greater than 1.
3. The function initializes a variable named bubbly to false.
4. The function initializes a variable named len to the size of the array.
5. The function enters a while loop that will run as long as bubbly is false.
6. The function enters a for loop that will run as long as i is less than len - 1.
7. The function checks to see if the value of array[i] is greater than the value of array[i + 1].
8. If the value of array[i] is greater than the value of array[i + 1], the function swaps the values of array[i] and array[i + 1].
9. The function prints the array.
10. The function sets bubbly to true.
11. The function decrements len by 1.
12. The function exits the while loop.
13. The function exits the function.
