1. The function max_heapify() takes an array, its size, and the index of the root node.
2. It then checks if the left and right child nodes are larger than the root node.
3. If they are, it sets the largest node as the root node.
4. If the largest node is not the root node, it swaps the root node with the largest node.
5. It then recursively calls itself on the largest node.

6. The first for loop is used to build a max heap.
7. The second for loop is used to sort the array.
8. The max_heapify function is used to maintain the max heap property.
9. The swap_ints function is used to swap the elements of the array.
10. The print_array function is used to print the array.
