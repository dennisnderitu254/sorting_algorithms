1. The function get_max() takes two arguments: an array of integers and the size of the array.
2. The function initializes a variable max to the first element of the array.
3. The for loop iterates over the array, comparing each element to max.
4. If the current element is greater than max, max is set to the current element.
5. The function returns the value of max.
6. First, it creates an array of integers called count.
7. Then, it fills count with the number of occurrences of each integer in array.
8. Then, it creates an array of integers called sorted.
9. Then, it fills sorted with the sorted values of array.
10. Finally, it fills array with the sorted values of sorted.
