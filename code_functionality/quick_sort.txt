1. The function lomuto_partition() takes the array, the size of the array, the left index, and the right index.
2. It then sets a pivot to the rightmost element of the array.
3. It then iterates through the array, swapping elements that are less than the pivot to the left of the pivot,
    and elements that are greater than the pivot to the right of the pivot.
4. It then returns the index of the pivot.
5. The function lomuto_sort() takes the array, the size of the array, and the left and right indices.
6. It then calls lomuto_partition() to get the index of the pivot.
7. It then recursively calls lomuto_sort() to sort the left and right subarrays.
8. The function quick_sort() takes the array and the size of the array.
9. It then calls lomuto_sort() to sort the array.
